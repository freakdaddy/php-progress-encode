# php-progress-encode
progress encode function written in php

This php function mirrors the functionality provided by the progress 9.1d (and probably newer) "encode" function.

I based it directly on the c# version provided at https://github.com/pvginkel/ProgressEncode

It is Public Domain.  Do as you wish with it.
